            72% of Sylhet is underwater, and much of it is with no electricity,

          <h2>Sylhet Flash Floods: Situation & Support</h2>
          <p>
            In the last few weeks, millions of people in the Sylhet and
            Sunamganj districts have experienced heavy rains and flash floods,
            leaving them homeless and without possessions. With homes crushed,
            objects floating away and people missing, the country is at high
            alert. This is not the first time the northeastern region (Sylhet)
            of Bangladesh is experiencing these floods, which have occurred
            twice already in 2022 alone.
